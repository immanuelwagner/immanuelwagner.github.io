Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transmit pictures of a specific location of interest and are either monitored remotely by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the specified area (La Vigne et al. 2011).

Beyond those limits, we often found action missing, thanks to prolonged and irregular gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
