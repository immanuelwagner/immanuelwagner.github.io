<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
