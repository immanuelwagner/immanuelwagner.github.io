<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Likewise good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Should be a much better way to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely advise.</p>
