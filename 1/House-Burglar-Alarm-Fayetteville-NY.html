<p>So, while alarm may have some advantage for alarm owners as part of an overall security package, the question remains whether non-alarm owners in the community need to take on a share of the cost. If alarm usage resulted in boosted public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much greater burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, less thefts throughout a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more apparent. Nevertheless, the fact that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute considerably to authorities ability to capture robbers makes the underwriting of alarm action by authorities and whole communities (all taxpayers subsidize cops response to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a costly and ineffective  approach to burglary decrease throughout an entire jurisdiction.</p>
