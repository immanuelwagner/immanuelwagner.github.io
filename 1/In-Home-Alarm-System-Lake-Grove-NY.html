<p>Ring may not be the most innovative system on our list (Vivint takes that prize), but it sure has actually gained quite the fanfare for many years. We have actually been testing Ring Alarm quite a bit recently, and we actually like the system for what it is. So what is it? Well, it's a prepackaged security package that uses basic intrusion protection with super-low regular monthly monitoring charges.

<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel posted a video showing how to hack into a SimpliSafe system utilizing a $2 remote. When it discovered any type of disturbance, SimpliSafe reacted with a statement saying the system would signal users. The company also questioned the video, declaring that there would need to be a perfect storm of scenarios for someone to effectively hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using two different 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units located 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to reproduce the concern. Although our screening should not be taken as definitive, we believe this concern is not likely to be a real-world problem for SimpliSafe customers who own the existing system.</p>
<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it challenging for the CCD or CMOS sensing unit to successfully translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>
