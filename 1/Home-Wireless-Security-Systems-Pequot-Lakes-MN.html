<p>Unlike Nest, TP-Link doesn't make you sign up for a function plan to get the most out of the Kasa Web Cam Outdoor. By simply purchasing the camera, you already get things like customized activity zones, and TP-Link is reasonably generous with its totally free cloud storage (2 days' worth of video history).

We evaluated Somfy's more expensive system, which included a wifi security camera, however more inexpensive sets are also offered. In spite of the hefty price here, there's no external monitoring option.</p>
