<p>The Nest Webcam IQ Outdoor is among the most pricey home security cameras around, however it's also among the smartest, too. This weatherproof home security camera has a tamper-resistant style, a triple microphone selection and HDR assistance for better-quality videos than what other cameras produce.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is especially impressive on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
