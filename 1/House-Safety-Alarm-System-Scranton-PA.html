When people are being viewed by the authorities - or conscious they might be seen at any time - they are more uncomfortable and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has actually explained, "knowing that you are being enjoyed by armed government representatives tends to put a damper on things. You don't wish to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself."

They might also put more thought into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang members, hookers or drug addicts." Indeed, the studies of cameras in Britain discovered that people deemed to be "out of time and location" with the environments underwent extended surveillance.</p>
