For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system. These companies created their equipment in this manner to make consumers stick with them longer, because changing monitoring companies implies hundreds of dollars down the drain and a big headache for consumers.
