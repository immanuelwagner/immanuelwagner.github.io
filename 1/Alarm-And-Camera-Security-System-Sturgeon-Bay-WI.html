<h3>Surveillance Camera Sturgeon Bay WI 54235</h3>
<p>Linking analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of directly plugging a BNC cable television from the DVR into the camera. To connect more cameras to the DVR system, you require additional cables. DVR systems are tough to scale up since when every BNC connection is occupied by a camera, you need to purchase a completely new DVR before adding another camera to the system. DVRs also need that the connected cameras remain in close proximity to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality starts to break down.</p>
<p>Are you in a home with a pre-wired security system? If so, having a hardwired security system set up may be a much easier and more cost effective option. But if your home currently has no pre-wired security system, a wireless one eliminates the requirement for drilling into your walls and also gives you the option of a Do It Yourself install. While wireless home security systems are popular and understood for a much easier, more streamlined installation, hardwired systems are more dependable because they aren't based on disturbance.</p>
