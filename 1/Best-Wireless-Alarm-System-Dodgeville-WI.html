<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Likewise good metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Should be a much better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
