<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don.

We concur with you about Blink's remarkable battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, however its recording capability is a bit minimal to suggest as a top choice.</p>
<p>This clever smart alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device. Throughout screening, we found it was simple to arm and disarm and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren quickly activating when movement was identified. We love that it likewise lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For most homes, you'll need a number of Minuts throughout your property, which can get costly. It's likewise worth keeping in mind that it has to be set up on the ceiling (it just keeps an eye on for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly. It likewise had the quietest alarm of all that we checked and there's no external monitoring service offered.</p>
