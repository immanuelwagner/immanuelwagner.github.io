<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item category is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security experts looking into Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Camera (KC120) for one of our top spots. However, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of up to 25 seconds in between recordings.
