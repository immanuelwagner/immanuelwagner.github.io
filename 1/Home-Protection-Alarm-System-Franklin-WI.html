<p>No matter what type of alarm you have, most alarm systems work the specific same method. They use open and closed circuits to transfer an electrical present. When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which suggests if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If someone were to open the door that would imply that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then set off the alarm system.
