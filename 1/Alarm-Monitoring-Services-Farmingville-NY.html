<p>The Canary is among the biggest cameras we evaluated, and it uses two-way communication with its paid Canary Membership.

The Netatmo Invite doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to recognize already-identified faces. And in spite of having an appealing price and good performance, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has complicated cloud storage that adds $65 to $150 annually to the cost of an otherwise budget camera.</p>
