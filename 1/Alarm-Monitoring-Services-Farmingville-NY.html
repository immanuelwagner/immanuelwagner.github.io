<p>The Canary is among the biggest cameras we evaluated, and it uses two-way communication with its paid Canary Membership. The price of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, however the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't constant throughout our testing. The Netatmo Invite doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to recognize already-identified faces. And in spite of having an appealing price and good performance, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has complicated cloud storage that adds $65 to $150 annually to the cost of an otherwise budget camera.</p>

You can get a solar panel device so you do not need to get rid of the battery as frequently, but it'll cost you extra. Read our Ring Alarm evaluation to see how Ring products all collaborate.</p>
