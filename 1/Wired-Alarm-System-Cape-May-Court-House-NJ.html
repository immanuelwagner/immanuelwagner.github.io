<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Likewise good metal construction.

Must be a better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
