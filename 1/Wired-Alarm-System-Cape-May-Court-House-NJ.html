<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Likewise good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>
