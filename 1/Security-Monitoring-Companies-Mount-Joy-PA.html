<p>Dependability has long been at the heart of the argument over hardwired versus wireless home security systems. It's an argument that's typically manipulated by factors such as uncertainty over the susceptibility of wireless systems, consisting of disturbance from radio signals and glitches that cause incorrect alarms.

<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that speak to an existing network needs to be within 300 feet for optimal efficiency. With cameras that communicate with wifi NVR's positioning of the camera near to the NVR is definitely something to be thought about. For instance if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of a concern but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on 2nd story wall, this would trigger a disturbance in the signal.
