Tech is expected to make our lives much easier and Hive's community lives up to that. It's all the function without any aggravation.</p>

A local system does not have the capacity to pair with other smart devices and can not be managed from another location. Also a local alarm will not call the authorities; it simply sets off an audible siren to alert people nearby.</p>
