Which suggests if the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits. If someone were to open the door that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then set off the alarm system. However, in an open circuit security system, unlocking permits the electrical current to flow throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will set off.</p>
