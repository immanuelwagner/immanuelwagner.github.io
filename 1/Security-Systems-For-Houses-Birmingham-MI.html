<p>Megapixel Cameras Now Readily Available. ASecureLife's suggestion: Go to Ring for a well-priced Do It Yourself system that you can self-monitor or get expertly monitored for a small charge.

<p>Purchasing equipment is much easier with SimpliSafe than with ADT monitoring through SafeStreets. With SimpliSafe, you can buy whatever online without making call or having a back-and-forth.
