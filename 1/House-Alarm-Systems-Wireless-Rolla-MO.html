<p>This cool wise alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device. Throughout testing, we discovered it was easy to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was precise, with the siren quickly setting off when movement was discovered. We love that it also lets you know when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For the majority of homes, you'll need a number of Minuts throughout your property, which can get costly.
