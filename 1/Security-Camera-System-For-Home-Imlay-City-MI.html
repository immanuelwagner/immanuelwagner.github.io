<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Also great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Must be a much better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
