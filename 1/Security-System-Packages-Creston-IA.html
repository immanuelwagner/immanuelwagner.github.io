<p>Megapixel Cameras Now Available. ASecureLife's suggestion: Go to Sound for a well-priced Do It Yourself system that you can self-monitor or get professionally monitored for a small fee.

We checked Somfy's more expensive system, which included a wifi security camera, but more economical kits are also readily available. Regardless of the hefty price here, there's no external monitoring choice.</p>
