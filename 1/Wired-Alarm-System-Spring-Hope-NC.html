<p>So, while alarm systems might have some advantage for alarm owners as part of a general security package, the question remains whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood must take on a share of the cost. If alarm usage resulted in enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms led to much greater burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, less burglaries across a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more apparent. Nevertheless, the truth that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute significantly to authorities ability to capture burglars makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by authorities and entire communities (all taxpayers support police action to alarmed properties) a costly and ineffective  technique to robbery reduction across an entire jurisdiction.</p>
