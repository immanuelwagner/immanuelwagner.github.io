Nest's Secure has the very best style of any system I tested, including clever things like integrating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit.

<p>Basically, wireless security systems rely on cellular signals to work - while wired systems work using radio frequency. With wireless security, your cameras, sensing units, lights and other security equipment are all connected to one base station or panel to get sensing units needed to manage your equipment including allowing, disabling and sending you instantaneous informs. As soon as a signal is gotten, you'll get an alert from the security provider's mobile app, text, e-mail, or web website.
