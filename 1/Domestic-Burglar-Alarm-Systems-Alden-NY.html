<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras might have the exact same resolution specification as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being topped a much broader location and therefore provides fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this means, by method of an example. Assume 2 cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This indicates the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the exact same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread that image throughout a far larger area and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of view.</p>
<p>Unlike most other cameras we tested, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ).

Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The membership is better when used in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Area feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid signals every time you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other individuals are home.</p>
