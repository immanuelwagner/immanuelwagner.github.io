<h3>Home Monitoring Security Systems Hazel Crest IL 60429</h3>

<p>The second wireless function involves how your security system interacts with the alarm monitoring station.

So, how do we get your alarm to interact with the monitoring station? Much in the very same method you do - we can connect via the web or through a wireless cell phone signal.</p>
