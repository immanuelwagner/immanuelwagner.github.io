<p>The rest of the field is more specialized, catering to advanced clever home fanatics or fans of a specific ecosytem of products. Nest's Secure has the best style of any system I checked, consisting of smart things like incorporating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one unit.
