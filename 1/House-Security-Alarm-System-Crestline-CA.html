<p>Simply bought a bullet ip system and definitely love it. Excellent clearness. I wished to set up viewing on my cell phone however had a couple questions that the tech responded to with ease. I Would certainly purchase from cctvsecuritypros once again. I highly advise this company. The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stand apart-- it's what provides the video history and smarter notifies, for instance. However, those functions come at a relatively high cost: $5 each month ($50 per year) for the very first camera for five days of video history, $10 monthly ($100 per year) for 10 days of video history, or $30 per month ($300 annually) for 1 month of video history.
