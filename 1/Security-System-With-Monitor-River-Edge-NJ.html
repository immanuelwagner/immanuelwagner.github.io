Audio and video verification methods utilize microphones and cameras to record audio frequencies, video signals, or image pictures. The source audio and video streams are sent over a communication link, typically an Internet protocol (IP) network, to the central station where displays recover the images through exclusive software application.

Must be a better method to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly advise.</p>
