We have discovered some enhancements given that the camera's launch, and will continue to update this evaluation and check, as needed.</p>

<p>While it hits the resolution, we think there's a little interpolation on its 4K video footage given that the Arlo Ultra's recordings can tend to be a little smeary when zoomed right in, but this is still by far the sharpest security camera we've seen in action, wireless or otherwise. Watch on what matters by streaming your security camera on your TV utilizing Google Nest or Home speaker or display screen and Chromecast or a TELEVISION with Chromecast built-in.</p>

<p>If you have an interest in a 4K camera system, you preferably will have an extremely high-speed Web connection and a robust home network, ideally an enterprise-grade network. As talked about above, the 4K camera images are large, which is a great deal of data to push around the home's network and additionally, to an offsite cloud recording service (more on that listed below).

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly outstanding by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
