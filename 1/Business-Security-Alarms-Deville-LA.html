<p>The Canary is one of the largest cameras we evaluated, and it provides two-way interaction with its paid Canary Membership.

Generally, consumer-grade cameras are built to work well when there is plenty of readily available light, and once the lighting becomes low or missing (believe sunset or nighttime), their pedigree starts to reveal.
