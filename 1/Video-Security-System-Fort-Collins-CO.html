Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are kept for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly cost (or $80 per year) to store 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we often found action missing out on, thanks to lengthy and irregular gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
