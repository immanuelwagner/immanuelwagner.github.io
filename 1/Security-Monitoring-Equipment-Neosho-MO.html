<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks entirely normal because the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the goal of catching video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as consumers realize that the affordable customer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's usually too late since the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
