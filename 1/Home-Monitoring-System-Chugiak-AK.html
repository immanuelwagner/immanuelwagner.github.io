These companies designed their equipment in this manner to make clients stay with them longer, due to the fact that changing monitoring companies suggests numerous dollars down the drain and a big headache for consumers. How did they do it? They put five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open internet. They were all running their most current software application and firmware.

They didn't state which device was the very first, and the last to fall, though.</p>
