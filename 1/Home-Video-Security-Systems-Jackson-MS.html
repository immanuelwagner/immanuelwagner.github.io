Here is what this means, by way of an example.

This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image across a far larger area and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
