"Once the crime and offence figures were adjusted to take account of the basic downward trend in criminal offenses and offenses," criminologists discovered in one research study, "decreases were kept in mind in specific categories but there was no evidence to suggest that the cameras had reduced crime in general in the city centre." A 2005 research study for the British Home Office likewise found that cameras did not cut crime or the worry of criminal activity (as had a 2002 research study, also for the British government).</p>
