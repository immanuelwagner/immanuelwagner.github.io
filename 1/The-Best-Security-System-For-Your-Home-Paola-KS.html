<p>6 basic CCTV security camera technologies exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets.

<p>I just finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential feature. Also good metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a better way to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>
