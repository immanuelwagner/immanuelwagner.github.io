<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Also good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Should be a much better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
