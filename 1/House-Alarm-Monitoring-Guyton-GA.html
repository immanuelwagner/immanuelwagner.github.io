Home automation is simple and convenient, and wireless systems help you automate your home that a lot easier. Smart locks, programmable thermostats, cameras, and other automated home devices are by their very nature wireless, and many home security companies use a home automation plan with an app to remotely manage everything on the system. That isn't to state that you can't have wired home automation, since you can, however automatic equipment that is hardwired into your system is slower and harder to encrypt. It isn't very smart. Wireless devices interact more safely and faster to other gadgets on the system and to the monitoring center (if you select monitoring).</p>
