<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring subtle but profound changes to the character of our public spaces. When people are being viewed by the authorities - or conscious they might be watched at any time - they are more uncomfortable and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has pointed out, "understanding that you are being viewed by armed federal government representatives tends to deter things. You do not wish to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he cautions, "individuals may find out to be cautious about the periodicals and books they check out in public, preventing titles that may alarm hidden observers. They may also put more thought into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang hookers, members or drug addicts." Indeed, the studies of cameras in Britain found that individuals deemed to be "out of time and location" with the surroundings went through extended surveillance.</p>

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
