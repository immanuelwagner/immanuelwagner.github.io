<p>Everything about Security offers expert, reputable alarm monitoring services for homes and companies throughout the higher Indianapolis area. Like any invasive technology, the benefits of deploying public video cameras must be balanced against the costs and risks.

Arlo states that the system utilizes three layers of encryption, with limited Web access on the Base Station and no local gain access to on the camera or the Base Station.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision performance, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far a lot of motion activates.</p>

<p>Focus on the existing lighting in the locations where you wish to install security cameras. Try to find the night vision variety of each camera and consider how much area you want to cover.
