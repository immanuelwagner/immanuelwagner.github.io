<p>An outdoor camera is ideal for watching on what's occurring outside of your home. These devices are weatherproof and generally require a nearby GFCI (ground fault circuit interrupter) outlet to supply power, although there are a handful of battery-powered models out there. Just like their indoor counterparts, outdoor cameras connect to your Wi-Fi network and allow you to see live video from your phone. They are relatively easy to install, however if you're not familiar or comfortable with electrical circuitry, you might want to have a professional electrical contractor do the job.</p>
<p>The Google Nest Web Cam IQ Outdoor is the most highly innovative outdoor camera we've checked.

It can distinguish between general motion and people, so it minimizes false alarms, and it can even determine people you've identified (after a learning period). However like all Nest cameras, this one needs the Nest Aware service to do anything beyond live watching.</p>
