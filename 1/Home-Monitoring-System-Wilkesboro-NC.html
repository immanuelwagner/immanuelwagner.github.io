ADT is one of the more costly home security companies, with costly video monitoring and high early termination fees. But ADT is understood to provide deals that relieve the cost of equipment, which makes the general cost for a 36-month contract a lot more reasonable.</p>

However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky.
