<p>The NVR removes these issues, because it is rather connected straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the very same network, generally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to send video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, just since they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is linked to the exact same network as the NVR. The biggest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will work with an offered video recorder before buying.</p>

The company that installed my alarm went out of business so I was on the hunt for a new monitoring company.
