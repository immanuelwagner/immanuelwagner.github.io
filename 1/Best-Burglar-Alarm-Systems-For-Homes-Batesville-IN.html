<p>You can utilize a wireless connection to run your SimpliSafe system, but it doesn't support Z-Wave, Zigbee, or IFTTT, meaning you won't have the ability to link it straight to other third-party devices like smart locks or automate particular actions in the home. You can, nevertheless, use Alexa to equip or disarm the SimpliSafe system and connect it to your Nest Thermostat to conserve energy based on when you're home or away.
