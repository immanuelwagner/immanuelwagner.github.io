<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against fraud, vandalism, and theft. Suggestion: Frequently keyholders are not offered and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we need to once again respond to the alarm; each response is billed.

For example, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a certain level, you can make it automatically shut off the heating systems. If the motion sensing units are triggered, you can immediately make the wise lights turn on to frighten potential robbers.</p>
