<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Likewise nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Should be a better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
