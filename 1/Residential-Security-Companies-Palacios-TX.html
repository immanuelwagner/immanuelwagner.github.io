<p>If you have a larger home or property you want to keep an eye on, SimpliSafe may be too minimal for you. The only outdoor security camera that's currently available is the Video Doorbell Pro, which is great for watching on visitors and bundle deliveries, however it leaves other parts of your backyard susceptible. This system may not be the best fit if you have a large lawn or sheds to secure. Unlike the outdoor Arlo cameras, the Arlo Q does not require a base station-- it links straight to any Wi-Fi network. However you can link the Q with other Arlo indoor and outdoor cameras in the Arlo app, which is available for iOS, Android, Fire OS, and any Web internet browser.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly impressive by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we wouldn't suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
