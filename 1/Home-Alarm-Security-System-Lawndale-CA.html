It's a dispute that's typically skewed by elements such as uncertainty over the susceptibility of wireless systems, including interference from radio signals and glitches that trigger false alarms. While improvements recently have actually made the innovation more popular and robust (some systems today have their own distinct wireless technology, which can't be disrupted by other signals), issues persist over vulnerabilities that don't affect hardwired systems.</p>

<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, and even in a garage without environment control, much of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the severe environment.</p>
