<p>The NVR eliminates these problems, since it is instead linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the same network, generally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely since they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The biggest disadvantage to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll require to know whether your cameras will be compatible with a given video recorder before buying.</p>
