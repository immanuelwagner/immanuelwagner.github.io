<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product category is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security professionals researching Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. We considered both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Camera (KC120) for among our top spots. However, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of up to 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can tape up to 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, however entries were frequently missing, in spite of appearing in the app's activity timeline.
