<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life expectancy, but outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, much of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the harsh environment.</p>

<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the entrance and then integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally typical given that the entrance and room seem at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the objective of catching video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when clients understand that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is doing not have HDR, it's usually far too late considering that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
