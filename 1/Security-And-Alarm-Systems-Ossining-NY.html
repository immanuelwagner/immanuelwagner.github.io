<p>Our SSA security system was set up at our new home on Friday, June 23rd. Ron Thompson was our sales specialist.

He sought advice from us regarding positioning of some of the monitoring devices in our home. He likewise assisted me in loading the app and finishing the online set-up process. He likewise examined the new keypad functionality. Both Darek and Ron were useful and really expert. Thanks.</p>
<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Likewise great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Need to be a better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
