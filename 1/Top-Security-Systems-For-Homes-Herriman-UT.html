<p>Six basic CCTV security camera innovations exist in todays CCTV surveillance markets. Plus, Amcrest is ONVIF compliant, which means you can utilize a number of various third-party apps, like Blue Iris, and make the camera work with other ONVIF-compliant gadgets. We believe burglar alarms work best when incorporated with all parts of your security system, such as video monitoring and gain access to control. That method when a door is opened, or a camera is gone by, you will be alerted. Normally, the bullet CCTV camera type is small, which could be 2.5 to 3 inches long decided by the CCTV camera lens types. So they are simpler to conceal and are less noticeable if you position it correctly.</p>

We haven't tested Eufy's security cameras yet so we'll take your recommendation into consideration. We really like the Eufy video doorbell, so I envision we'll evaluate the security cameras soon. SimpliSafe is not excellent at smart home assistance.
