<p>Cameras with integrated in wifi that speak to an existing network needs to be within 300 feet for optimal efficiency. With cameras that interact with wifi NVR's placement of the camera near the NVR is definitely something to be taken into account. For example if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there wouldn't be much of an issue but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on 2nd story wall, this would trigger a disturbance in the signal.
