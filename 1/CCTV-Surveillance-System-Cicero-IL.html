<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly remarkable on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that said, we wouldn't advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic.

However if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
