<p>Cross-zoning is a technique that does not need a new keypad. Utilizing numerous sensors to monitor activity in one location, software analyses input from all the sources. For example, if a motion detector trips in one location, the signal is tape-recorded and the central-station monitor notifies the client. A 2nd alarm signal-- received in an adjacent zone within a short time-- is the confirmation the central-station monitor requires to ask for a dispatch right away.
