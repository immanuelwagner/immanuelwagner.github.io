<p>Developing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or residential property is the obligation of the whole neighborhood. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the first question you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will require. The answer depends upon a couple of factors: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the quantity of archived footage you plan to keep and the length of time you plan to keep recorded footage. If there are many cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the footage is going to eat up storage space quickly.

<p>It's becoming more popular. But for the time being, if you see an outdoor camera that uses two-way audio, go for it.
