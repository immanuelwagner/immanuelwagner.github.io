However, bear in mind that the monitoring company's response time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will respond to the alarm-- if they react at all. In Los Angeles, for example, all alarm calls need to be confirmed, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone. Salt Lake City requires confirmation from a private security personnel. A number of cities also need a permit to even own and run a home security system. Rules such as these are designed to limit the time and resources that police and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Many towns will fine you for a lot of false alarms.</p>
