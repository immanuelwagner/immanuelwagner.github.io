<p>We like that the Argus 2 includes a color night vision choice, but the black and white variation can really be clearer and provide you higher-quality footage. This isn't actually a big deal considering the Argus 2's cost and all its other functions-- but for the record, stick with white and black. With Arlo Pro 3, you'll get 3 months of Arlo smart service. However the coolest function is that you can charge it with the assistance of solar energy with a solar panel charger.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>
