Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are stored for as much as 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 each year) to save 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we typically found action missing, thanks to irregular and prolonged spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
