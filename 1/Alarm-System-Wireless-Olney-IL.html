<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you desire one? Here is a quick explanation of how thermal cameras work: All objects release infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature.

A thermal camera includes a heat sensing unit that is capable of discovering small distinctions in temperature level. The device collects the infrared radiation from things in the scene and creates an electronic image based on information about the temperature level differences.

Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to implement that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
