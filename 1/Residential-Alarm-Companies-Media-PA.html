It makes no sense that we don't have equivalent laws for video recording.

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks completely typical because the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone getting in the store.
