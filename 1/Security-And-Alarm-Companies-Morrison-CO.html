<p>Cameras with built in wifi that talk with an existing network should be within 300 feet for ideal performance.

For example if the only thing obstructing the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of an issue but if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is installed on 2nd story wall, this would cause a disruption in the signal.

<p>Best Professional Installation Security Company - While some security systems offer simple DIY installation, other companies provide (and often require) expert installation. Expert installation is offered for hardwired and wireless home security systems. Remember that cameras with two-way audio typically work like walkie talkies. You press a button in the app to talk, and, while you're talking, you can't hear what's occurring on the other end.

<p>I've covered customer electronic devices for more than 15 years and have checked scores of smart-home gadgets, from remotes and security cameras to AV receivers and speakers.

These cameras are true 1080p and work completely right out of package. They are well aligned and focused. The clearness is actually great. Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see respectable after that. These cameras are what you need to buy, and don't go cheap.</p>
