<p>Discover how to create, construct, and install commercial grade security camera systems to increase worker safety and decrease criminal offense. The latest Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, but it pumps images as much as 4K resolution and has a great daytime image. In our testing, however, we discovered the motion sensing unit to be sensitive, with awful night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot. We are verifying with Arlo whether our unit was faulty, and so we may revisit this evaluation.
