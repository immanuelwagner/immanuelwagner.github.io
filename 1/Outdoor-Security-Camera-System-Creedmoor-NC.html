That stated, we have definitely no other qualms about the Swann's motion detection qualifications - it's hits the spot in terms of level of sensitivity, preventing incorrect positives in our tests and including heat detection as an added bonus. It's quick to send out an alert and convenient  in terms of storage considered that it supports both cloud uploading and an on-board microSD card for each camera.</p>

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. However if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
