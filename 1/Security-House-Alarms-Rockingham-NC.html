Salt Lake City requires verification from a personal security personnel. Numerous cities also require a permit to even own and run a home security system. Guidelines such as these are designed to limit the time and resources that cops and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Numerous municipalities will fine you for a lot of incorrect alarms.</p>
