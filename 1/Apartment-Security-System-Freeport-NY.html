The rate of the Canary View makes the size a bit more tasty, however the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't consistent during our screening. The Netatmo Welcome doesn't have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it continuously asked us to recognize already-identified faces. And despite having an attractive cost and good efficiency, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has confusing cloud storage that includes $65 to $150 per year to the cost of an otherwise budget camera.</p>
