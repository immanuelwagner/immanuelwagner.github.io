<p>Closed circuit television (CCTV) surveillance is a form of situational criminal activity avoidance created to prevent both individual and residential or commercial property crime and can be utilized in location of, or in addition to, authorities. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and send images of a particular area of interest and are either monitored from another location by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the defined area (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is thought that the increased surveillance provided by CCTV will minimize crime and increase arrest, without displacing criminal offense to other neighboring areas where CCTV is not in use (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>

Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are kept for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month cost (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limits, we frequently found action missing, thanks to inconsistent and lengthy gaps in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
<p>When combined with face recognition, surveillance camera networks raise extra personal privacy and civil liberties issues-- especially since face acknowledgment data is prone to mistake. Amazon's face acknowledgment tool, Rekognition, is amongst the real-time video face acknowledgment items currently being piloted by police departments around the nation, along with the FBI.
