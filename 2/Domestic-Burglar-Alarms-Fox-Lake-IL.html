"As soon as the criminal offense and offence figures were adjusted to take account of the general downward pattern in offenses and crimes," criminologists discovered in one research study, "reductions were noted in specific classifications but there was no evidence to suggest that the cameras had actually lowered criminal activity overall in the city centre." A 2005 study for the British Home Office likewise found that cameras did not cut crime or the fear of criminal activity (as had a 2002 research study, likewise for the British federal government).</p>
