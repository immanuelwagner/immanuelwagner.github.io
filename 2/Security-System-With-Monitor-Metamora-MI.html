<p>After purchasing, setting up, and utilizing these systems for 8 months, we found 4 standout companies. Vivint, Frontpoint, ADT, and SimpliSafe all provide an impressive consumer experience and instinctive, ingenious security tech. We 'd be comfy equipping our own homes with any of them-- although each excels in a specific area. ADT provides exceptional brand recognition (a powerful crime deterrent), Vivint aces home automation, and Frontpoint offers a high-support alternative for those who want a streamlined, DIY system.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not terrific-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have horrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion activates.</p>
