Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are saved for up to 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly charge (or $80 annually) to keep 30-second clips for 30 days.

Occupants, unlike property owners, normally avoid making long-term modifications to their homes.

On the other hand, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or affixed to walls and entryways with detachable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensors and other components can quickly be set up at different residential or commercial properties later, and wireless systems are quickly expanded with new parts too. Wireless security strategies also permit remote control of the system and basic home automation.
