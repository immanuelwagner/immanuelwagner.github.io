Storage capability: For video recorders, the very first concern you need to ask yourself is just how much storage you will need.

<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky.

<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential feature. Likewise good metal construction.

Should be a better method to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
