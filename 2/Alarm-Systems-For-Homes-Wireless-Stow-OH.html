This chapter governs alarm system systems meant to summon authorities department workers, needs registration, evaluation of fees for excessive false burglar alarms, offers procedures for repeat transgressors, and offers an efficient date. While some vestiges of the old market stay, today's homeowners exist with a lot more alternatives.
