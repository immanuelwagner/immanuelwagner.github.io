<p>While every property owner frets about burglaries, hesitation has surrounded home security systems due to their generally high expenses, complicated contracts with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces typically leading to false alarms.

<p>We mounted our test group of outdoor Wi-Fi cameras to a board outside the house so we might point them at the very same spot and expose them all to the exact same lighting conditions and New England weather condition. The exceptions were cameras that were incorporated into outdoor lighting fixtures, which I had actually installed on the deck by a licensed electrical contractor (who occurs to be my partner).
