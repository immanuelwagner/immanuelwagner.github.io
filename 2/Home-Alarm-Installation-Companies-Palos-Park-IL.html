<p>Establishing a safe and secure  environment for a commercial or house is the responsibility of the entire neighborhood. Storage capacity: For video recorders, the very first question you have to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The response depends upon a couple of aspects: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you plan to save and for how long you plan to keep documented video. If there are many cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the footage is going to eat up storage space rapidly.
