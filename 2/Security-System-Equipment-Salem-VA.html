According to the United States' National Criminal Activity Victimization Study, billions of dollars are lost every year to break-in, robbery, and theft. Just purchased and set up all cameras. It is working for now. However, I had issues during the setup as only 1 camera was able to pickup the signal. It took me a while to figure out how to manually add the other cameras.</p>
<p>As for how to utilize one, they work the like a lot of other security cameras and hook into your existing doorbell setup. In some cases you do not even need to hardwire them, depending on which model you choose. Just like any security system, the more equipment you add, the more expensive it gets.

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not great but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the expensive Arlo Ultra, which we found to have dreadful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
