For instance, no other company can monitor a SimpliSafe, Cox, Brinks Home, or Xfinity Home system.

How did they do it? They put five routers, DVRs and IP cameras on the open web. They were all running their latest software and firmware. According to the report, one gadget was hacked within a few minutes, while the rest were done and dusted within a day. They didn't state which device was the first, and the last to fall, though.</p>
<p>Buying equipment is simpler with SimpliSafe than with ADT monitoring through SafeStreets. With SimpliSafe, you can buy everything online without making telephone call or having a back-and-forth.
