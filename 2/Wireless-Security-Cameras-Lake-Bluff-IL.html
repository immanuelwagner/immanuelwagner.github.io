Salt Lake City requires confirmation from a personal security personnel. Several cities likewise need a license to even run a home and own security system. Guidelines such as these are created to restrict the time and resources that police and fire departments waste on false alarms. Many municipalities will fine you for a lot of false alarms.</p>
