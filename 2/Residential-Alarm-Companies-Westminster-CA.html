However, if your internet decreases, sadly, you will be without an alarm up until it comes back up.</p>

SimpliSafe's Hearth Plan includes all the home security essentials you need, plus fire and smoke detection. This isn't the cheapest SimpliSafe plan, but we believe the addition of smoke protection is a plus worth spending for.</p>
