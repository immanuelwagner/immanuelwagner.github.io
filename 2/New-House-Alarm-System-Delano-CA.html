<p>So, while alarm might have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a total security package, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the community need to take on a share of the cost. If alarm use resulted in enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms caused much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, fewer robberies throughout an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more obvious.
