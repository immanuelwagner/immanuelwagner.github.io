<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really essential function. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Must be a better method to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly advise.</p>
