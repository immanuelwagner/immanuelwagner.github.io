For example, if a motion detector trips in one area, the signal is taped and the central-station monitor notifies the client. A 2nd alarm signal-- received in a nearby zone within a short time-- is the verification the central-station monitor requires to request a dispatch instantly. This builds in increased protection and a stop working safe must a door blow open or a bird rattle an exterior window.</p>
