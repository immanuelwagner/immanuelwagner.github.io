<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change.

Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Should be a much better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
