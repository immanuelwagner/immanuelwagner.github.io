<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that seems to make every effort to make a camera with the most challenging setup known to man. Here's how it plays out: First you need to put and download the app in your e-mail address. Then you get in the WiFi details of the network you're trying to connect to. Then the phone plays a screeching, electronic sound wave to the camera to transmit the WiFi information. (You should play this at complete volume or it won't work). Windows smash, pets shout, cats shriek, children sob. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the first ten seconds. It doesn't work. And it never ever works.</p>
