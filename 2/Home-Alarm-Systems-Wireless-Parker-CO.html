<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really crucial feature. Also good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Must be a much better method to carry out that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Extremely advise.</p>
