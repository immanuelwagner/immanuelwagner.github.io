Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are stored for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 regular monthly fee (or $80 annually) to store 30-second clips for 30 days. Beyond those limits, we frequently discovered action missing, thanks to inconsistent and prolonged gaps in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
