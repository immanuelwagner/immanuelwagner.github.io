<p>While every homeowner frets about burglaries, suspicion has surrounded home security systems due to their generally high expenses, complex agreements with long-term lock-ins, and difficult-to-use interfaces frequently leading to incorrect alarms. ELERTS is a free smart device app that permits citizens who see something suspicious to take a picture and rapidly send it to public safety officials. For instance, a public transit rider may notice someone behaving suspiciously. Many individuals are fiddling, texting or surfing with their mobile phones.
