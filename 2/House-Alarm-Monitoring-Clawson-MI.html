<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Rather, you can filter event alerts only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available just with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more signals, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is more useful when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Location feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts whenever you walk by.

<p>How long does it typically require to flip to your alarm monitoring service? I utilize VOIP today. May transfer to cellular eventually in the future but staying with dial-up for now.
