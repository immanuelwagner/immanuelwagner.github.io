The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Also good metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall.
