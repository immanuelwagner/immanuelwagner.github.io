<p>ADT licensed provider SafeStreets charges a $99 (or more) installation cost, however the brand doesn't otherwise charge up front for a system it states deserves $1,300. The equipment's all offered by 3rd parties, so what you get might be from a different manufacturer than the equipment your neighbor received. Why's that?

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion sets off.</p>
