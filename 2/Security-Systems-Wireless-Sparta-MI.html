<p>Get best-in-class security, plus smart home automation the entire household will enjoy. ADT is a household name, so we regularly experiment with their systems to guarantee they're still up-to-task.

CCTV is likewise grounded in situational criminal offense prevention strategy, which argues that opportunities to offend can be reduced by modifying a variety of systems such as increasing the threat of a wrongdoer being nabbed, increasing the effort to commit the criminal offense, reducing benefits from criminal offense commission, and decreasing justifications that generate criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011). This means that the offender should be aware of the added surveillance for it to attain its desired result.</p>
