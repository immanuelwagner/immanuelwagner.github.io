<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring profound but subtle modifications to the character of our public areas. When residents are being enjoyed by the authorities - or conscious they may be watched at any time - they are more awkward and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has explained, "knowing that you are being watched by armed federal government agents tends to deter things. You don't want to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he warns, "people may learn to be cautious about the books and regulars they read in public, avoiding titles that may alarm hidden observers. They may also put more thought into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang druggies, hookers or members." Undoubtedly, the studies of cameras in Britain found that individuals deemed to be "out of time and place" with the environments were subjected to extended surveillance.</p>
<p>Put simply, wireless security systems count on cellular signals to work - while wired systems work using radio frequency.
