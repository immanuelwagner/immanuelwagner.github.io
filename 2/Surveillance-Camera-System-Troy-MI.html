<p>Establishing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or residential property is the obligation of the whole neighborhood. Storage capability: For video recorders, the very first concern you have to ask yourself is how much storage you will require. The answer hinges on a couple of aspects: the variety of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived footage you plan to keep and how long you plan to keep recorded video. If there are numerous cameras shooting in a greater resolution, the video footage is going to eat up storage area rapidly.

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.
