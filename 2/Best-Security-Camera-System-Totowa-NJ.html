Here is what this means, by method of an example. Assume two cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread that image across a far bigger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>

Regardless of a general enhancement in wireless technology, there seem less ways for hardwired systems to be disrupted and disabled.</p>
