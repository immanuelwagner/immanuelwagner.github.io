<h3>Home Security System Packages in California</h3>
<p>We do not recommend the SmartThings SmartCam because it's more complicated than it should be. Recordings, alerts, and integration all need separate IFTTT-style rules. Recordings are caught as 10-second clips that are stored for approximately 24 hours, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month charge (or $80 each year) to store 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limits, we often found action missing, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets extremely hot.</p>
