<p>Our burglar alarms might be equipped in the Away" or Stay" mode. When the burglar alarms are activated, each monitored zone has the capability to recognize an offense.

Getting in the code on the burglar alarm's keypad and shutting off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
