Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Place function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent alerts each time you walk by.
