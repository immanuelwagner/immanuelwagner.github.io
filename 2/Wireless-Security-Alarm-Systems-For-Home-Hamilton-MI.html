<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus fraud, vandalism, and theft. Suggestion: Typically keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. We must again react to the alarm; each action is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder available to reset the alarm is one way of removing expensive false alarms.

<p>Given that the glass housing doesn't get in the way, they aren't quite as vandal-proof as dome cameras, however they make up for it in abilities.

With that said, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. But if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
