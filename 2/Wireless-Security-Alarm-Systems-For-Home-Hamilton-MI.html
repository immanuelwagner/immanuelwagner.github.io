We must again react to the alarm; each action is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder available to reset the alarm is one way of removing expensive false alarms.

<p>Given that the glass housing doesn't get in the way, they aren't quite as vandal-proof as dome cameras, however they make up for it in abilities.

For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. But if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
