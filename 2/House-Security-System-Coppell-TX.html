Here's a take a look at Vivint security cameras for outdoor and indoor surveillance. Signed up for service for my Simon XTi and was active with their service an hour later on. The company that installed my alarm went out of business so I was on the hunt for a new monitoring company. These individuals are $18 a month cheaper and been in business 3 decades so I'm comfortable providing a try.

<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we wouldn't recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll like SimpliSafe.</p>
