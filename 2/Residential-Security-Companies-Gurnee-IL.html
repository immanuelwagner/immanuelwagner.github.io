<p>So, while alarm systems may have some advantage for alarm owners as part of a general security package, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the community need to shoulder a share of the cost. If alarm usage resulted in improved public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, fewer burglaries throughout a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more obvious. Nevertheless, the truth that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute significantly to authorities ability to collar burglars makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by police and entire communities (all taxpayers subsidize police response to alarmed properties) a ineffective and costly approach to burglary decrease throughout a whole jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Unmonitored systems won't provide the exact same level of protection for your home, either.
