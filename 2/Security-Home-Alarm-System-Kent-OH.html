Just a couple decades back, the home security market was dominated by a few huge names using expensive, stiff plans with little versatility and unfriendly, long-term contracts.

IP cameras that are connected to the exact same network, typically by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely because they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is connected to the exact same network as the NVR. The largest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.

The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Likewise nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
