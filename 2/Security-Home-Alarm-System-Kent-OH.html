There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is connected to the exact same network as the NVR.

The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Likewise nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better method to implement that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
