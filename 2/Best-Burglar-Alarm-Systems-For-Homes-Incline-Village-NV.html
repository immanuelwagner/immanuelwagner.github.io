<p>The Nest Webcam Outdoor's 1080p images and noise were impressive in our testing-- during the day and in the evening-- with a wide, 130-degree field of vision and 8 x digital zoom that permitted us to get a closer view in live video. We need to keep in mind that the camera would periodically downgrade the picture quality based upon readily available bandwidth, which could fluctuate throughout the day. Nest consists of the choice to set the bandwidth to low, medium, and high, but that may beat the purpose of having a 1080p camera.</p>
