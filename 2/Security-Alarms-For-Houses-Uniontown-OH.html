<p>The issue with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to effectively translate the images, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the severe environment.</p>

<p>You would be hard-pressed to discriminate between 1080p and 4K resolution when looking at a regular camera image. The one significant advantage of 4K resolution is the ability to deal with detail after the truth, which means that users can zoom in on details such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. However, while 4K resolution offers some benefits, it likewise brings with it some downsides. 4K images are huge and take up a lot of taping storage space. A lot, in fact, that they need about four times the hard disk area of 1080p to record the very same length of video footage.
