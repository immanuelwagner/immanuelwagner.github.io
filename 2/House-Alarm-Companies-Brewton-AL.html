<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware service called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and an exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely normal since the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone getting in the store.
