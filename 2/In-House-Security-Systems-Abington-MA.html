<p>Home security systems and modern clever home abilities and compatibilities enable you to take advantage of their sensing units and cameras directly from your phone.

State-of-the-art sensing units discover movement inside and outdoors, listen for the sound of breaking glass to guard against trespassers and protect prized possessions. While many people use the term CCTV to describe both IP and analog cameras, strictly speaking, the term must be restricted to describing analog cameras.</p>
<p>If there's one company challenging ADT's yard sign monopoly, it's Xfinity Home Security The multi-platform company first delved into home security in 2011, and its signature red lawn indication is nearly as common as ADT's classic blue. The very best reason to go with Xfinity might be that you're already a Comcast customer. Bundling opens the door for deals, and makes your monthly bill paying that much easier.
