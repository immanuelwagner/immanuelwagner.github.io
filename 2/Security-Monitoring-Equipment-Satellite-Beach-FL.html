<p>I just completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The essential distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also nice metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
