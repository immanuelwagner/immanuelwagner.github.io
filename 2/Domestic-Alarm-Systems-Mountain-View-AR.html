Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are stored for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month charge (or $80 each year) to store 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limits, we typically found action missing, thanks to irregular and lengthy spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceedingly hot.</p>
