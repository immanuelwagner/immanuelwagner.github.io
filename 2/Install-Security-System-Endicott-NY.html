<p>This clever wise alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device. During testing, we discovered it was easy to arm and deactivate and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren quickly activating when movement was detected. We love that it likewise lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For the majority of homes, you'll need a number of Minuts throughout your home, which can get costly. It's also worth keeping in mind that it has to be set up on the ceiling (it only monitors for motion in the 25m squared listed below), which is fiddly.
