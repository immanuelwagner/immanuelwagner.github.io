<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that seems to aim to make a camera with the most challenging setup understood to guy. Here's how it plays out: First you have to download the app and put in your e-mail address. Then you get in the WiFi details of the network you're attempting to link to. Then the phone plays a screeching, electronic acoustic wave to the camera to transmit the WiFi info. (You must play this at complete volume or it will not work). Windows smash, canines groan, cats scream, infants cry. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the very first 10 seconds. It does not work. And it never ever works.</p>
