<p>Ahhh EZVIZ, the company that seems to make every effort to make a camera with the most tough setup known to man. Here's how it plays out: First you need to put and download the app in your email address. Then you go into the WiFi details of the network you're trying to link to. Then the phone plays a piercing, electronic acoustic wave to the camera to transfer the WiFi info. (You need to play this at full volume or it will not work). Windows smash, canines wail, felines scream, infants sob. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the first 10 seconds. It doesn't work. And it never works.</p>

<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event notifications just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the membership is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Place feature can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals each time you walk by.

<p>When looking at a regular camera image, you would be hard-pressed to tell the distinction in between 1080p and 4K resolution. The one significant advantage of 4K resolution is the capability to deal with detail after the reality, which means that users can zoom in on details such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. However, while 4K resolution provides some advantages, it also brings with it some downsides. 4K images are large and use up a lot of tape-recording storage space.
