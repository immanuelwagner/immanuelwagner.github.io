<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial function. Likewise nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a better way to implement that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
