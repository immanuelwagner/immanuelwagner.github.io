<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Likewise good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Should be a better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly recommend.</p>
