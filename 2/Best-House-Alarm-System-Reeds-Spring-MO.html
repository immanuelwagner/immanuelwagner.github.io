<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you want one? Here is a short description of how thermal cameras work: All things give off infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature level. The infrared energy produced by an item is called its heat signature. In general, the hotter an item is, the more radiation it releases. A thermal camera includes a heat sensing unit that is capable of spotting small distinctions in temperature level. The gadget collects the infrared radiation from things in the scene and produces an electronic image based upon details about the temperature distinctions. Due to the fact that things are seldom precisely the same temperature level as other objects around them, a thermal camera can spot them, and they will appear as distinct in a thermal image.</p>
