<p>The NVR removes these problems, since it is rather linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the very same network, generally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are likewise wireless and can transfer footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity limitations so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR. The largest downside to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR. So you'll need to know whether your cameras will work with an offered video recorder before buying.</p>

<p>Pay attention to the existing lighting in the locations where you want to install security cameras. Try to find the night vision variety of each camera and consider just how much location you want to cover.
