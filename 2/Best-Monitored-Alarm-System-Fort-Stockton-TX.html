<p>The security systems I've created and carried out are strictly for monitoring activity of a prospective target, whether from a terrorist threat or community thieves or vandals.

<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and sometimes, the real lens. After a couple of years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it difficult for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Indoors, these devices have a far longer life span, however outdoors, and even in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clarity catching the severe environment.</p>
