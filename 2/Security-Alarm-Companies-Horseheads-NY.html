<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely normal given that the entrance and space appear to be at the very same brightness level.
