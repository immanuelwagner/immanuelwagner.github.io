<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the same resolution spec as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being topped a much larger area and for that reason offers less pixels per inch. Here is what this implies, by way of an example. Assume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) designs. This implies the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the very same image sensing unit, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread that image throughout a far bigger area and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
<p>Unlike many other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter event alerts only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. When used in high-traffic locations, the membership is more useful. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals every time you stroll by. Unusually, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
