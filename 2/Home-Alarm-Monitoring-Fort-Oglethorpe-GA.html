In addition to operating as a deterrent, cameras can alert authorities of crimes as they take place, which can allow officers to react quickly and efficiently (La Vigne et al. 2011).

There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is connected to the very same network as the NVR. The largest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll require to know whether your cameras will be compatible with an offered video recorder before purchasing.</p>
