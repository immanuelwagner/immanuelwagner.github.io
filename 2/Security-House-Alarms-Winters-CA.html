In addition, there are no signal or data limitations to wired devices and sensing units.

Rather, you can filter event alerts only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes.
