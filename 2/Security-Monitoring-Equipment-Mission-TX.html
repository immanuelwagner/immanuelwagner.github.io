<p>So, while alarm might have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a total security plan, the question stays whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood need to carry a share of the cost. If alarm use led to improved public safety-- that is, alarms caused much higher burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, less robberies throughout an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more evident. However, the truth that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute substantially to cops ability to collar intruders makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by authorities and entire communities (all taxpayers subsidize police action to alarmed properties) a ineffective and pricey technique to robbery decrease throughout a whole jurisdiction.</p>
