<p>With Lorex security camera systems you get completely included, professional-grade security options that are simple to install and simple to use. Honeywell Overall Connect cameras represent the next generation of residential video surveillance equipment.

<p>What is a thermal camera, and where might you desire one? Here is a brief description of how thermal cameras work: All objects give off infrared energy (heat) as a function of their temperature level. The infrared energy discharged by an object is called its heat signature. In basic, the hotter an item is, the more radiation it gives off. A thermal camera includes a heat sensor that is capable of detecting tiny differences in temperature level. The device collects the infrared radiation from things in the scene and produces an electronic image based upon details about the temperature level distinctions. Since items are seldom exactly the same temperature level as other things around them, a thermal camera can identify them, and they will appear as distinct in a thermal image.</p>
