<p>Thanks to recent improvements in technology, wireless security systems are now as effective as wired systems If you've decided to install an alarm system, you should consider the following benefits of wireless innovation.

<p>A system that requires a contract may be a wise option for those who are cash-strapped or don't want to spend for the equipment up-front. Why? Due to the fact that contract-based security systems usually do not come with in advance costs. Rather, the expenses are expanded over the length of the contract. We have actually seen 1-year, all the way up to 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we recommend contract-free systems if you do not wish to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term arrangement (and who does?). Our choice: No contract.</p>

<p>A lot of modern-day CCTV video surveillance systems integrate DVRs (digital video recorders) which make it possible for operators to enjoy some of the benefits of a network-based surveillance setup.
