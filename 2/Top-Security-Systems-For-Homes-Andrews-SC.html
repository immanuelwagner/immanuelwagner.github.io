Devices that come with the SimpliSafe system consist of the SimpliCam, an indoor camera with a motion sensing unit and HD video quality, and a keychain remote utilized to arm or deactivate the system. Simplisafe does not consist of home automation functions, other than Nest combination, which may be a turn off for some.</p>
<p>Pan and tilt: If you're seeing pets or older kids from another location from the office or on a beach, you might want to be able to move the camera angle.
