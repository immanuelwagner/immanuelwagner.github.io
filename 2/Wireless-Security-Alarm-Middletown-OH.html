Rather, you can filter occasion notifications only by high activity, days, or person (the latter is readily available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The membership is better when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies every time you walk by.
