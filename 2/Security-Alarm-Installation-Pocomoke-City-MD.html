<p>The NVR removes these issues, due to the fact that it is rather connected directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the exact same network, usually by method of a PoE switch, are then able to send footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, just because they can accept a new camera once it is contributed to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance restrictions so long as a camera is linked to the very same network as the NVR. The biggest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR.

Recordings are captured as 10-second clips that are stored for approximately 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 monthly fee (or $80 per year) to keep 30-second clips for 1 month. Beyond those limitations, we frequently found action missing, thanks to prolonged and irregular spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
