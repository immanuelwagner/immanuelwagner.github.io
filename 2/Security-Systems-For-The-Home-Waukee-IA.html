<p>Burglar alarms have actually ended up being standard equipment in stores and other services, and they're becoming progressively typical in private homes as well. A wireless security camera might need a cable connection for power, but may use Wi-Fi for storing footage. One benefit of a wireless security camera is its ease of installation.
